# CS51-Final-Project
CS51 Final Project - Movie Ratings Predictor using Random Forests and Support Vector Regression Algorithm by Peter Chang, Zachry Bai, Dor Baruch, Ann Hwang

All of our code was written and executed with Python 2.7.9, and can be executed as such.

To run the randomforest_ratingpredict.py, just execute "python randomforest_ratingpredict.py" in the terminal.
Then follow the instruction to input the number of trees, number of features (<6), and maximum depth of trees.
It will create the predictions_500.csv in the Prediction folder.
The accuracy (percentage) can be calculated by running percentageerror.py.
